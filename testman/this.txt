NAME
this - pointer
DESCRIPTION
The this pointer is a special pointer that exists for a class
while a nonstatic member function is executing. It is a pointer
to an object of the type of the class, and it points to the
object for which the member function currently is executing.

void Date::month_display()
{
	// These two statements do the same thing.
	cout << month;
	cout << this -> month;
}

One use of this pointer allows member functions to return
the invoking objet (or its address or a reference to it)
to the caller.

// Overloaded Date assignment.
Date& Date::operator=(const Date& dt)
{
    if (this != &dt)
    {
        mo = dt.mo;
        da = dt.da;
        yr = dt.yr;
        delete [] month;
        if (dt.month != 0)
        {
            month = new char [strlen(dt.month)+1];
            strcpy(month, dt.month);
        }
        else
            month = 0;
